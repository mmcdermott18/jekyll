        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <h4>P4. Limitations</h4>
        <p>Each class you will create a video based on a design concept or principle. The first video will have no limitations on it, only the time (15 seconds) and size (1080x1080) will be required. During the following classes we will impose a series of limitations that you will respond to by remaking the original video. The goal is not to find ways to work around the limitations but to find ways to use the limitations. The end will be a series of four videos that should be visual different but all feel like a set based on their topic.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of each class we will screen the videos and the top video in each category will win a prize. There will be two People's Choice awards. Those winners will also get to choose the limitations for the next video.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Video 1</strong> No limitations</li>
          <li><strong>Video 2</strong> Must have a duck, everything always visible on screen, must have audio</li>
          <li><strong>Video 3</strong> Black and white, must have 10 transitions, have 1 image</li>
          <li><strong>Video 4</strong> At least 3 colors, at least 2 fonts, make it ugly, use 2 After Effects effects</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each individual video will be submitted through Blackboard before class and the final four videos will be combined into one video and uploaded to Vimeo on the last day. This video should have a title slide before each video listing the limitations.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>November 20</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>November 27</strong> Video 1 due</li>
          <li><strong>November 29</strong> Video 2 due</li>
          <li><strong>December 4</strong> Video 3 due</li>
          <li><strong>December 6</strong> Video 4 due, combined videos due</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>E7. Effects</h4>
        <p>Create three videos that are at least three seconds long. Each video should use at least one effect in After Effects. You can use type, shapes, images, and videos or some combination of the four. Do not bring in audio. The videos should be either Halloween themed or Go Vote themed.</p>
        <p>At the end of class or on Thursday if not everyone is done we will screen the videos and the top two videos in each category will win a prize. There will be a People's Choice award and a Teacher's Choice award.</p>

          <li><strong>October 30</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>P3. A Title Sequence</h4>
        <p>Design a title sequence for a movie or tv show of your choice. The title sequence should be at minimum around one minute long. The content from the existing title sequence (names, title, studios, etc.) should be used in the new titles.</p>

        <h4>E5. Poster Animations</h4>
        <p>Recreate a <a href="http://www.blanka.co.uk/Design/Muller-Brockmann">Joseph MÃ¼ller-Brockmann poster</a> (download some images <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/93mz3dqum2kckik/AACvG4Y57cacxn6UcN-OYwsTa?dl=0">here)</a> as accurately as you can in Illustrator (1080x1920) and then animate it in After Effects. The posters are generally in German so you might not be able to read all the content but I would try to find out what kind of event the poster is promoting. Knowing the event might help influence what sort of animation your poster takes on. Your animation should enhance and bring the poster to life. Try to only animate existing pieces of the poster and not bring in additional forms.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>October 4</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>October 11</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>P2. A Moving Poster</h4>
        <p>Design a moving poster for a future event that is happening on campus. The design must retain the formal elements of a poster, communicate using the traditional rhetoric of a poster, and must scale to fit the portrait format (1080x1920). The choice of movement should feel natural and not distract from the content of the poster. The movement should emphasize the message of the poster not confuse the message.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>October 2</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>October 4</strong> First draft of still poster</li>
          <li><strong>October 11</strong> Storyboards for movement of poster</li>
          <li><strong>October 16&ndash;18</strong> Individual meetings</li>
          <li><strong>October 23</strong> Review poster in motion</li>
          <li><strong>October 25</strong> Poster Due</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>P1. Type in Motion</h4>
        <p>Make at least a one minute video combining type and audio. Keep in mind that certain aspects of the audio can influence decisions you make while animating the type. Outside shapes, colors, and lines can be use but no pictures or videos. The video should be include the title scene that includes the title for the audio and who made the audio. For example, a song would have a song title and artist name and a movie scene would have the movie title and characters involved.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>September 11</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>September 13</strong> Audio selected and initial sketches</li>
          <li><strong>September 18</strong> First draft of the title scene and selected pieces of the video</li>
          <li><strong>September 20</strong> Continue working</li>
          <li><strong>September 25</strong> First full draft due</li>
          <li><strong>September 27</strong> Refinements</li>
          <li><strong>October 2</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>E4. Text Animations</h4>
        <p>Make three different text animations using animators on your text layer.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>September 11</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>September 13</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>E3. Null Objects</h4>
        <p>Find a short amount of type (maybe a tweet) that would do well in a animation. Create an animation for that type using using null objects.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>September 6</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>September 11</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>E2. Motion and Sound</h4>
        <p>Make a 15 second animation using the layered Illustrator file on Blackboard and some kind of audio. The animation should be 15 seconds long and uploaded to the Vimeo group when you are done.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>September 4</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>September 6</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>E1. Literal Type</h4>
        <p>Choose a word from the list below and create an animation that reinforces the word's meaning. Do this for a total of 5 words in the list. The typeface should be Futura Bold and should be black type on a white background. The file do not have to loop seamlessly but can if it makes sense. You can come up with your own word for one of the five files.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>transition</li>
          <li>expansion</li>
          <li>migration</li>
          <li>elimination</li>
          <li>repetition</li>
          <li>compression</li>
          <li>disruption</li>
          <li>silence</li>
          <li>softness</li>
          <li>loudness</li>
          <li>heavy</li>
          <li>lightness</li>
          <li>addition</li>
          <li>subtraction</li>
          <li>movement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One animation should be made in Photoshop as a 30 frame (or more) gif. One animation should be made in InDesign as a 30 page (or more) document, exported as jpgs, then brought in to After Effects and made into at least a 1 second mov. One animation should be made entirely in After Effects and should be at least a 1 second move. The final two animations can be made using whichever process makes the most sence.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>August 30</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>September 4</strong> Due</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>E0. Gif</h4>
        <p>A simple way to start thinking about motion is through a gif, a short animate image that is controlled through individual frames. Using something interesting that happened over the summer as inspiration, make a 15 to 30 frame, looping gif.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>August 28</strong> Start</li>
          <li><strong>August 30</strong> Due</li>
